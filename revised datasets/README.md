## Building a Refined Movie Dataset: A Streamlined Approach

We have refined our approach to create a more precise and reliable movie dataset. Here's a concise overview of the steps we took to construct this new dataset.

### 1. Initial Dataset and Strategy

- **Original Plan**: Initially, we integrated four datasets: "The Movies Industry Dataset," "IMDb 5000 Movies Multiple Genres Dataset," "IMDb 5000 Movies Dataset," and "Top 500 Movies Budget," as defined in the README for the old dataset.
- **Challenges**: This approach led to suboptimal performance in our predictive models due to forced integration and potential confusion from movies with similar titles.

### 2. Transition to a New Dataset

- **Re-evaluation**: We paused to re-evaluate our methodology, focusing on a deeper analysis of the data to improve model accuracy.
- **New Approach**: We opted for a refined dataset derived solely from "The Movies Industry Dataset," excluding entries with missing values.

### 3. Rationale Behind the Transition

- **Performance Issues**: The initial dataset's performance was hindered by lower accuracy rates due to inadequate variable selection and forced dataset integration.
- **Complexities**: Merging datasets with similar movie titles added unnecessary complexity and noise.

### 4. Benefits of the Optimized Dataset

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: The new dataset includes additional input variables such as Year, Production Company, and Votes, which enhance the accuracy of our machine learning model in predicting movie revenues.
- **Single Source**: Sourcing the dataset from a single origin eliminated extraneous noise and improved data integrity.
- **Reliability**: By eliminating entries with null values, we ensured the dataset's reliability before subjecting it to our predictive models.

### 5. Final Input and Output Features

- **Input Features**: `name`, `rating`, `genre`, `year`, `released`, `score`, `votes`, `director`, `writer`, `star`, `country`, `budget`, `company`, `runtime`
- **Output Feature**: `gross`

Our refined approach has resulted in a more robust and accurate dataset, better suited for predicting movie revenues and providing valuable insights into the cinematic world. ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š
